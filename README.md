# Inclusive-AI
This project aims to research inclusive AI and comprehend why and how AI becomes biased as well as explore five existing inclusive AI building tools.

This project focuses on addressing major issues concerning inclusive AI, such as identifying potential causes of bias in AI systems, analyzing techniques for transitioning current biased AI into inclusive AI, assessing its advantages, and exploring some real-world examples. Additionally, it will focus on exploring five existing tools like AIF360, LIME, SHAP, and TCAV, which assist in developing inclusive AI.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of inclusive AI, documenting the research conducted on tools for building inclusive AI. It examines how these tools achieve inclusiveness in AI, the key considerations for developing inclusive AI, and the methods used to measure bias in AI.
